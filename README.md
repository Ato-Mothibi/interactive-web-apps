# interactive-web-apps
I created my first interactive web design page that has may folders inside:
1) IWA01:
  It has: -HTML
          -CSS
          -JavaScript

2)IWA02:
 It has: -IWA2-Challenge1:    
                *HTML
                *JavaScript
         -IWA2-Challenge2:
                *HTML
                *JavaScript
         -IWA2-Challenge3:
                *HTML
                *JavaScript

3)IWA03: 
It has: -IWA3-Challenge1: It's program that runs on js. It has to replace the word Loading from javascript with a dynamic copyright message
                     JavaScript
                *configuration.js
                *script.js
                     HTML
                *index.html

              Challenge2: A program that has three sripts, each script file corresponds to an individual that is part of the team. Each file should replace loading(from HTML) with the roles

                     JavaScript
              *alex.js
              *johannes.js
              *nwabisa.js
              script.js
                     HTML
              *index.html

4) IWA04:     Challenge1: A program to output several South African public holidays for the year 2050. There is also a condition that only logs “Youth Day” if the current status is student and only “Christmas Day” if the status is “parent”. Once all the public holidays have been logged, the final output should log three separate messages each showing the following:

The status value as declared initially (”parent”)
The year as declared initially (2050)
The total count of holidays for the above settings (9)
                     JavaScript
              *script.js

                     HTML
              *index.html

5) IWA05:     Challenge1: If a user is in South Africa their shipping should be R400, if a user is in Namibia their shipping should be $600 for all other countries shipping is $800. Note that we do not ship to North Korea and users from North Korea should receive a notice of such.

In addition to the above, if a user’s cost without shipping is equal to or more than R1000 or $60 in cost and they are based in South Africa or Namibia, then their shipping should be free. However, this is only the case if the number of customers is exactly 1, otherwise, it should show the message stored WARNING.

The code is supposed to log the following to the console: Price: R1270.
                     JavaScript
              *script.js

                     HTML
              *index.html

6)IWA06:      Challenge1: the user has accidently typed the alphabetical O character instead of the zero 0 number.

This means that the primary validation should fail resolving to false, however since the secondary number is correct it should pass (resolving to true).
                     JavaScript
              *script.js

                     HTML
              *index.html

              Challenge2:
This program is meant to run every hour of the day to check a user’s balance should be calculated. The only time the balance should be calculated is when it is the start of a new day (in other words midnight, when hourOfDay and minuteOfDay are both 0). However, there are cases where the time is not known in which case both hourOfDay and minuteOfDay will be undefined. To prevent any bugs, the balance should not be calculated if the time is not known.

Before calculating the cost, tax needs to be deduced as a percentage of the salary. After this is done all expenses should be subtracted such as food, transport and rent. The final result should be 274.0499. However, you are required to use toFixed(2) to only show cents (up to only 2 decimals) and prefix the value with a R symbol. This means that the final logged value should be R 274.05.
                     JavaScript
              *script.js

                     HTML
              *index.html

7)IWA07:      Challenge1: The following program is meant to add the following three values together and log 10.
                     JavaScript
              *script.js

                     HTML
              *index.html

              Challenge2:  
The following code should log a message that says Good morning with a dynamically entered name (from two possible variables).

Either a nickname and/or firstname can be added as variables in the code. If a nickname is present it should be displayed instead of the firstname, if there is no nickname then the firstname should be shown. 
                     JavaScript
              *script.js

                     HTML
              *index.html

              Challenge3:
The following code is meant to output as a single value (only a single console.log) but split into three different lines.

Note that it is very that the value be shown as a positive of money “owed”, i.e. it should be R 14 976.20
                     JavaScript
              *script.js

                     HTML
              *index.html
